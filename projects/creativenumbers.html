            <h2>Creative-Numbers.com</h2>
            <p>I created this website in the early part of 2021 and have been slowly building
                it up with new features.

            <h2>Particles</h2>
            <p>The particle system was wrote in vanilla javascript and was a oppurtunity to 
                to add some interesting logic behind the websites design.

            <h2>Customisation</h2>
            <p>To follow up on the particle system I wanted to add some customisation for the user.
                This customisation allowed the particle system to be customised to a persons own
                descretion. This then got added to many of the pages as section background colors.

            <h2>Things learnt</h2>
            <p>This project has taught me so much. I enjoyed the challenges of logical problem solving
                regarding particles. how to program things so that they could be customised
