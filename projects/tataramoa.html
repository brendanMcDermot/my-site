            <h2>Tātarāmoa</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">As part of the BICT at Ara Institute of Canterbury, The final part of the degree
                was a work integrated learning project. I was lucky enough to intern at
                a large Christchurch Geo-Modelling company called Seequent. This company was very well
                established and could teach me much.

            <h3>The Business Value</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">With the acquisition of Seequent and Sensemetrics into the Bentley
                Systems family, a possible resource/oppurtunity  was not being explored. this oppurtunity 
                was for Seequent-applications to use Sensemetrics data to help provide further
                information to Seequent clientele.

            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">To manage time and work I used excel to map hours which could 
                automatically update a burndown chart. This provided a clear visual representation
                of whether the project and academic deliverables were on track.

            <h3>Methodology - Scrum</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The ideal methodology for the project was Scrum, as many stakeholders would be
                involved and requirements were not clear at the start of development. It was also
                likely that these requirements would need to be tweaked during development. As
                scrum was already the methodology of choice for many of the Seequent teams, it was
                very easy to merge Tātarāmoa with the existing teams processes.

            <h3>Risk and Quality Management</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The Microsoft risk management excel tool was used to record identified
                risks, estimate their likelihood/impact and quantify each risk. From this mitigation
                and contingency plans could be made and would be incorporated into the planning of
                the overall process.

            </div>
            <p>The Quality assurance plan consisted of white and black box testing for the API as well
                as quality assurance and quality control tables (based on the Virginia Tech model). 
                these tables identified processes,
                deliverables and increments. Many of these were easily evidenced by many of the
                quality assurance measured already implemented in Seequent such as, GitHub Pull-Requests,
                definitions of done and Jira tickets.

            <h3>What was Learned</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">This experience was fantastic for developing myself as a software
                developer. It was an introduction to the implementation of processes within larger
                organisations and I was able to learn and discuss best practices and concepts with
                more senior developers.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>The Final Deliverables</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">along with the numerous academic deliverables such as reports
                and methodology essays The main industry deliverables at the end of the project was
                Tataramoa - A proxy/facade API for allowing Seequent client applications to talk
                to the Sensemetrics API.

            <img src="../images/tataramoaAllTogether.png" alt="">
            <p class="image_figure">Tātarāmoa - Sequence Diagram</p>
            <p> This could allow for the implementation of Seequents on
                standard auth, the bucketing and aggregation of data while removing  some of the
                complexity in communicating with Sensemetrics.
