            <h3>Hello World</h3>
            <p>My name is Brendan Mc Dermott. I am originaly from Northern Ireland and I am 
                currently studying the Bachelors of Information
                Communication Technology at Ara Institute of Canterbury. My Aim is to continually improve 
                my knowledge of IT. In particular software/web/app development, and develop a career that

            <p>While i dont feel like an expert in any of the following I have had a good introduction
                and have spent much time getting a basic competency with each of these languages. 
                As my course draws to an end i would like to be specialised in at least two or three of 
                these languages. Ideally an internship at the right company would help with this greatly,
                but untill then i shall continue to create projects like the one you see before you.

            <p>For a long time I have tried to experience much of what the world has to offer
                some of my jobs have been very exciting while others allowed me to do exciting things.
                I am now at a point where i would like a carreer where i can develop my
                skills year after year. In 2019 I started down the path by enrolling in a Livel 4 It course with 
                ara with the intention to move on to the Bachelors. I achieced (3xA+ and 1xA_). As it stands
                with my degree I have achieved 3xB+ 2xA- 3xA and 7xA+
