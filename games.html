        <h2>A Winters Knight</h2>
        <p>In the third semester at Ara, i was presented the oppurtunity to choose a project. While most
            of my class opted to build websites i wanted to expand my knowledge and dive in to game 
            development. This was my first attemp at unity though i had been somewhat familiar with blender.
            What resulted was A Winters Knight, a 2.5D Mario style game.

        <h2>EyeballMaze</h2>
        <p>For my Introduction to Java class we were tasked with creating a model for the game
            Eyeball maze and running tests on said model. the final part of the course was to 
            create the view in android studio. Much like the C# game i created in the previous 
            semester. each level was loaded programatically with all of the tile sizes to fit
            the assigned playable area.

        <h2>Thesius and the Minotaur</h2>
        <p>My Introduction to C# class got students to build a model of the game Theseus and 
            the Minotaur and test the model. The final part of the class was to build the view 
            in either WPF, Winform or both. I chose to do it in both. The most interesting part of this
            project was the automation of drawing each level. Walls would be drawn using the pen tool and
            arrays of vertical and horizontal co-ordinates calculated from data in the model. If you 
            added a binary string (which was how levels where being added) then you did not have to do 
            anything else. Everything needed by the view was already calculated.
