            <h2>3D modelling</h2>
            <p>
                I have been 3D modelling on and off over the last few years using blender. As i now get to explore 
                the world of unity and game creation or webgl and 3D website graphics, once again my interest
                has been peaked.

            <h2>Playing Music (Guitar)</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoy trying to play any musical instrument. I have been playing guitar on and off again for the last 20 
                years and enjoy a multitude of genres from classical to pop, theme tunes to heavy metal.
