                <p>In the forth semester of my degree i was tasked with creating three websites. One that 
                    utilises bootstrap, a wordpress e-commerce site and a health referrals website. The task
                    was to create this referral website with only css (no frameworks) and django. The website
                    has full CRUD functionality, authorization and uses a Mysql database to store all the 
                    data created. The website of course also had to be fully responsive and designed with
                    accessability in mind. Each of these websites was also running on HTTPS and was hosted
                    on a AWS instance.

        <h2>Election Tracker</h2>
        <p>With one concept i was tasked with building the same website in different ways using
            javascript frameworks. below you can see my election tracker app which was built either in 
            vue.js React or vanilla javascript. while there where a few shortcuts taken due to time 
            constraints each version has exactly the same functionality as the others. some of the notable 
            features where saving and loading data to the browser and a search algorithm to help find
            specific entries.
