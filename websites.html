        <h2>Creative numbers</h2>
        <p>I created this website in the early part of 2021 as a portfolio site to show prospective
            employers. The main feature in the first iteration (current iteration), was the home page.
            This page was supposed to catch the users attention. The particle system which was
            calculated in javascript and drawn on a canvas at a lower z-index seemed like a playful way
            to show something cool. Off course this was not particularly hard as there were many resources 
            available for this sort of thing. So in an effort to add complexity so that the home page 
            served to "impress". I made the values customisable and allowed them to be saved to the browsers
            local storage, allowing users to fully customise the home screen.

        <h2>NZ Health</h2>
        <p>In the forth semester of my degree i was tasked with creating three websites. One that 
            utilises bootstrap, a wordpress e-commerce site and a health referrals website. The task
            was to create this referral website with only css (no frameworks) and django. The website
            has full CRUD functionality, authorization and uses a Mysql database to store all the 
            data created. The website of course also had to be fully responsive and designed with
            accessability in mind. Each of these websites was also running on HTTPS and was hosted
            on a AWS instance.

        <h2>Election Tracker</h2>
        <p>With one concept i was tasked with building the same website in different ways using
            javascript frameworks. below you can see my election tracker app which was built either in 
            vue.js React or vanilla javascript. while there where a few shortcuts taken due to time 
            constraints each version has exactly the same functionality as the others. some of the notable 
            features where saving and loading data to the browser and a search algorithm to help find
            specific entries.

        <h2>Tech Colab (Tradie website)</h2>
        <p>This website was created by a group of students for a real world client. It was
            creted as part of "tech colab" which was an Ara pilot program looking to get a 
            select few students to create real world products for people. this website was
            created using the MERN stack and was a joint effort between myself,

        <h2>Wordpress E-Commerce Store)</h2>
        <p>This website was an E-Commerce website created in wordpress and running on an AWS
            instance. It was part of an assignment along with 2 other sites. The website was only set
            up to sell two products and each of those products where tagged so that they could be
            easily search via a search bar. pretty simple
