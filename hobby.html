    <div class="hobby_panel">
        <h2>3D modelling (blender)</h2>
        <p>As i learn more about the world of 3D and 3D rendering i have been creating more and more
            3D models. while things like three.js and even 3D in vanilla javascript have peaked my
            interest, my main interest in this hobby lies with blender. Blender is a free 3D engine
            that allows modelling, rigging and animation.

    <div class="hobby_panel">
        <h2>Guitar</h2>
        <p>I have an interest in almost any musical instrument though guitar has been my staple 
            for many many years. When i was younger i even competed in a uk wide battle of the bands
            for colleges. My band at the time won in Ireland and Scotland. We did not place in London but
            the experience was fantastic.

        <h2>Digital Art</h2>
        <p>Another hobby is digital painting. Originally I used photoshop for this but ever since
            I got a surface go I have been using Krita. this is a more artist centric software.
        </p>

    <div class="hobby_panel">
        <h2>Games</h2>
        <p>Ever since i was young i have always enjoyed games. I currently enjoy games with high 
            difficulty levels. learning the intricacies of some games is as deep as learning a musical
            instrument. I also love games with great story and design. possibly the continuous 
            problem solving that is required in games may have even been a catalyst in my enjoyment of
            coding.
